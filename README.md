# Pomodoro App

## About Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It's designed to improve productivity by breaking work periods into 25-minute intervals called "Pomodoros," separated by short breaks.
This technique aims to reduce the impact of distractions, enhance focus and concentration, and maintain mental agility throughout the workday.
